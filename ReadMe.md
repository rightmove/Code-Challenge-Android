# Android Software Engineer Test

Create an app using Kotlin to load data from an API and display the average property price.

Design have asked for the a text saying 'What is the average property price?' to be in the middle of the screen and the answer to be displayed 10dp underneath.

The background of the screen should be white (#FFFFFF) and the text should be berry (#262637) and size 14sp.

- Request JSON from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rightmove/Code-Challenge-Android/master/properties.json
- Calculate the average property price from the results
- Display the answer on the app screen
